# VisionCraft: The Winter Challenge

**Make your winter worthwhile** by joining this exciting Winter Camp project! In this project, you’ll have the opportunity to reconstruct 3D models of real-world objects from video data. You'll learn how to process video frames, generate OBJ models, and refine them using Blender to create high-quality, realistic renderings—all while diving deep into computer vision and modeling.

## Four-Week Plan

### Week 1: Python Basics, Git Installation, and Version Control
- Learn the fundamentals of Python programming.
- Set up Git for version control and manage your project code efficiently.

### Week 2: OpenCV Fundamentals and Video Processing
- Understand how to process video data using OpenCV.
- Extract video frames and prepare data for 3D modeling.

### Week 3: Metadata Exploration and Frame Analysis
- Explore video metadata.
- Analyze frames for important features required for generating 3D models.

### Week 4: Final Pipeline Integration and 3D Model Visualization
- Integrate the steps into a complete pipeline.
- Visualize and refine the 3D models generated from the video data.

## Expected Outcome

By the end of this project, you'll have built a pipeline that:
- Extracts video frames.
- Analyzes metadata.
- Generates 3D models.

## Expected Weekly Time Commitment

- **5-6 hours per week** to stay on track with the project tasks.
